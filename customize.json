  "wishText": " Hey Ailyn,
I just wanted to say… I miss you so much already. It’s hard knowing I won’t get to see you at school anymore — your smile, your energy, even just those small moments we shared in passing. Things won’t feel the same without you around.
I really hope this next chapter brings you happiness and growth, but part of me wishes we had a little more time. Take care always, and just know you’re deeply missed.",
